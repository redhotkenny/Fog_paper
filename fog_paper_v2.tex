\begin{abstract}

We propose a methodology to estimate cloud water interception (CWI) by a forest using a Rutter-type interception model. The approach requires the acquisition of continuous records of meteorological variables, including fog interception, which is measured using a fog gauge system. Throughfall measurements performed below the forest are used only for calibration and validation of the model, which represents a significant advantage considering the complexity of such type of measurements. The methodology is applied on a set of data collected during a period of two years in an endemic forest in the highlands of San Cristobal Island (Galapagos), where a semi-permanent fog layer covers the study area during six months per year. Our results show that CWI reaches 22\% and 10\% of the total water input during the first and second year, respectively. As expected, during the hot seasons, where fog is absent, CWI is negligible, while it represents 34\% and 18\% of the water inputs during the first and second cool seasons. We attribute this marked difference to a lower fog liquid water content during the second year as a consequence of the sea surface temperature anomaly that precedes the 2015-2016 (revisa los años) El Niño event. The application of this methodology provides an indirect way to quantify CWI by vegetation using artificial fog gauges. In addition, it allows the identification of controlling factors of CWI and it could be useful to compare CWI in contrasting land covers.

\section{Introduction}
Cloud water interception ($CWI$) by the vegetation subject to fog occurrence is an important hydrological process because it is an additional water input to the canopy water budget. Moreover, it has been associated with a reduction in the evapotranspiration \citep{Bruijnzeel2001, Ritteretal2008}. Its measurement is critical for designing suitable water management policies, especially in regions with limited water resources and subject to fog. 

Basically, three main factors influence $CWI$ \citep{Villegasetal2008, Ritteretal2008, Braumanetal2010}: climatic conditions (air liquid content, drop size, wind speed), canopy structure (size, height, density, morphology) and location (elevation, terrain slope and orientation). Attempts to quantify $CWI$ have been proposed in different locations around the world \citep{Ingrahametal1988, CavalierandGoldstein1989, Hamiltonetal1995, Holder2004, McJannetetal2007a, Gabrieletal2008, GomezPeraltaetal2008, Ritteretal2008, Villegasetal2008, Holwerdaetal2010, Ueharaetal2012, Pryetetal2012a}, reporting variable results showing that $CWI$ is highly dependable on the site. Methods to quantify $CWI$ include the use of passive fog gauges \citep{Juvik1978, Ingrahametal1988, Aboaletal2000, Villegasetal2008, Frumauetal2011}, measurements of net precipitation (throughfall and stemflow) \citep{Holder2003, Gabrieletal2008, Pradaetal2009, Pryetetal2012a} and other alternatives such as the use of eddy covariance instruments \citep{Changetal2002, Holwerdaetal2006, Eugsteretal2006}. Even though the latter has proven to effectively provide estimates of fog deposition, it is expensive and the data treatment is challenging. Fog gauges are relatively easy to install but the estimates they provide are related to their capacity to catch fog and not to the vegetation. Thus, these are indirect measurements that are dependable on the fog gauge design. Net precipitation ($P_{net}$) measurements in that sense, provide direct estimations related to the canopy capacity to intercept fog, once the interception variable in the canopy water balance is known. Few studies have related estimates of $CWI$ from passive fog gauges with the ones from vegetation. \cite{Ritteretal2008} used data from fog gauges to derive fog characteristics in subtropical elfin cloud forest in La Gomera (Canary Islands). \cite{Holwerdaetal2011} found that estimated $CWI$ in a Puerto Rican elfin cloud forest correlated significantly with measured $CWI$ from passive fog gauges.

Interception models have been used in the context of $CWI$ to estimate rainfall evaporation losses, where the measured $P_{net}$ is compared with the simulated one in conditions without fog (rain-only events) and the difference is attributed to $CWI$ \citep{Holwerdaetal2010, Pryetetal2012a}. These models require measurements of rainfall and $P_{net}$, whereas evaporation is estimated with an energy balance approach (most commonly Penman–Monteith theory). The drawback of this approach is that continuous measurements of $P_{net}$ are required, which can be challenging. The two most common approaches used are \citep{Muzyloetal2009}:  i) Rutter-type models (e.g. \cite{Liu1997, Rutter1975}), based on a running canopy water budget, and 2) Gash-type models (e.g. \cite{Gash1979, Zengetal2000}), based on discrete rainfall events. Generally, Gash models are preferred because of their simplicity, but they require the separation of individual rainfall events. In the context of fog occurrence and continuous rainfall, this could be quite challenging. This could be the reason why Rutter models were more frequently used in tropical rainforest climates \citep{Muzyloetal2009}. Moreover, \cite{vanDijketal2015} studied sources of errors in the estimation of interception losses with canopy water budgets, and showed that the Rutter-type models with accurate estimations of evaporation provide the best results. 

The objective of this work is to propose and validate a methodology to estimate $CWI$ by a forest using a Rutter-type interception model, in which $CWI$ is estimated from monitoring of climatic variables, including fog interception by a passive fog gauge system. $CWI$ estimates in the forest are obtained from measurements of a passive fog gauge and not as the remaining variable in the canopy water balance. In this way, measured $P_{net}$ is only used for calibration and validation purposes. We tested this methodology in an endemic forest in the highlands of San Cristobal Island (Galapagos Archipelago). 

\section{Study Area}
\subsection{Climatic and hydrological context}
The Galapagos Archipelago is located in the Eastern Pacific, $1000$ $\mathrm{km}$ West of the Ecuadorian mainland. The climatic conditions are atypical for its equatorial position. Essentially, there are two distinct seasons: 1) The cool “garua” season from June to December, characterized by relative low sea and air temperatures, orographic precipitations and the occurrence of a semi-permanent fog layer that covers the highlands of the main islands \citep{TruemananddOzouville2010, Pryetetal2012a}. 2) The hot “invierno” season from January to May, characterized by high sea and air temperatures, and high intensity convective precipitations \citep{GrantandBoag1980, Dunbaretal1994, TruemananddOzouville2010}. Considering long term records (1965-2015) of a weather station operated by the \emph{Charles Darwin Foundation} at the coast of Santa Cruz Island (alt. 6 m a.s.l.), the median annual rainfall is 278 mm and the average air temperature is 24 $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$.

San Cristobal Island, located at the East of Galapagos, is the only island of the Archipelago with permanent surface water resources (Figure 1), which are located at the southern side of the island. The hydrological system is complex in this zone. In the highlands, gentle slopes allow the pounding of rainfall. At mid-slope, a well-developed drainage network can be observed, where several ravines are fed by perennial springs. The interpretation from the AEM SkyTEM dataset \cite{dOzouville2007} suggests that springs are originated from perched aquifers formed over impervious layers, which are disconnected from the basal aquifer \citep{Pryetetal2012b, Violetteetal2014}. The inhabitants are entirely dependent on the streams of this zone for water supply. 

\subsection{Highlands vegetation and study plot}
The study area lies in the southern windward highlands, within the agricultural zone. Originally, highlands hosted ferns and forest of endemic \emph{Miconia Robinsoniana} shrub, classified as a low-elevation elfin cloud forest \citep{Pryetetal2012a}. \emph{Miconias} grow on steep slopes exposed to winds and fog forming small patches varying in height. Due to the development of agriculture, endemic forest are being converted into pasture and secondary forests. However, vast regions of the highlands are covered by the endemic forest, so they are still representative of the contemporary vegetation. For this reason, we identified one study plot representative of the \emph{Miconia} forests.

The study plot is characterized by a single-storied architecture of \emph{Miconias} with similar morphological features (Table 1). Even if the shrubs height is homogeneous, their stems diameter is relatively diverse. Branches have different inclinations, many ramifications from the bottom and they are covered by abundant mosses (Figure 2). Leaves have broadly elongated elliptic shape with conical edges with inclination towards the ground.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Climatic monitoring} \label{sec:fog_int_moni}
Climatic monitoring was conducted with a weather station (Figure 2) in the clearings close to the study plot (ca. 50 m). Data was recorded using a Campbell CR1000 datalogger. Rainfall was measured with a Texas TE525MM rain gauge placed at 1.5 m above the ground. Wind speed and direction were monitored with a Young WindSentry Kit positioned at 2 m above the ground. Solar radiation, relative humidity ($RH$) and temperature were measured at 2 m above the ground, with a Kipp\&Zonen SPLite silicone pyranometer and a Campbell CS215 T\&RH sensor, respectively. Fog interception was measured with a cylindrical fog gauge (height 40 cm, 12 cm in diameter) made of plastic mesh (1 mm) at 2 m above the ground. Intercepted water was collected with a funnel at the base of the cylinder and diverted to an automatic tipping bucket gauge. Using this system, fog interception and rainfall are collected, hence the partition into rainfall and fog interception is necessary.

Throughfall measurements were performed within 6m$\times$6m plot beneath the vegetation canopy using \citep{Dominguez2016}: i) a set of troughs draining into an automatic tipping bucket gauge \citep{Ziegleretal2009, Zimmermannetal2014}, and ii) small collectors distributed randomly within the plot \citep{Keimetal2005, Staelensetal2006, Zimmermannetal2009}. Troughs were made of 3-m long PVC pipes of 10-cm diameter. 6 troughs were used corresponding to a collection area of 1.8 m$^2$. Manual collectors are used to assess the spatial representativity of the continuous troughs measurements. Collectors were made from funnels of 16-cm diameter placed over 2-L containers. A total of 30 collectors (total area of 0.6 m$^2$) were used. They remained fixed during the study period. Measurements were performed manually, but the number of measurements were limited due to difficulties of access to the field notably after rainfall events. 

Stemflow was measured using a malleable plastic funnel adhered to the trunk and connected to a hose that drips collected water into a 2-L capacity container. Funnels were made for each trunk according to its diameter. They were placed at 0.5 m above the ground. Stemflow measurements were limited to 8 trunks with a diameter larger than 6 cm. We could not measure stemflow for the rest of the trunks within the plot (78). However, mean height of measured stemflow of the 8 trunks represented less than 0.5\% of the incident rainfall. In Santa Cruz Island, \cite{Pryetetal2012a} estimated stemflow of 0.6\% of the incident rainfall for the same vegetation. Thus, considering that errors of throughfall measurements might be larger than measured stemflow, we assumed a negligible stemflow.

All rain gauges were corrected for losses during bucket rotation using a dynamic calibration at the laboratory \citep{CalderandKidd1978}. Measured throughfall reached a plateau of 20 mmh$^{-1}$ despite rainfall was higher. It seems that the capacity of throughfall measured by the troughs cannot be larger than this value (30 tips per minute). Measured throughfall during a storm event was eliminated after the plateau. Therefore, some entire storm events are missing during the hot seasons. 

\subsection{Canopy model}
Canopy evaporation, net precipitation and cloud water interception are estimated using a modified sparse version of the original Rutter model \citep{Rutter1971, Rutter1975}. The model is based on a running water balance that requires parameters describing the structure, drainage and interception capacity of the canopy (Figure 4). In contrast to \cite{Rutter1975} and \cite{Valenteetal1997}, the separation into a canopy and trunks compartment is not considered in the current model version (stemflow is negligible compared to the rainfall amount), thus, water balance calculations are performed only for the canopy and $P_{net}$ is reduced to throughfall \citep{Pryetetal2012a}. However, in cases where stemflow amount is relevant, the trunk compartment can be easily included in this model.

All variables referring to a water storage, or flux, are expressed as depth of water over the whole plot area.
The model considers changes in the water stored within the canopy compartment derived from the water balance for a plot area. In the $CWI$ the water budget can be written as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_can_bal}
    \Delta C/\Delta t = (1 - p) \times RF - D - E 
\end{equation}
where $\Delta C/\Delta t$ $\mathrm{[LT^{-1}]}$ is the variation of the canopy water storage ($C$), $p$ is the free throughfall coefficient, $RF$ $\mathrm{[LT^{-1}]}$ is the rainfall rate, $D$ $\mathrm{[LT^{-1}]}$ is the drainage rate from the canopy and $E$ $\mathrm{[LT^{-1}]}$ is the wet canopy evaporation rate. Rainfall input is a proportion of the canopy cover ($1-p$). The canopy storage capacity ($S$) $\mathrm{[L]}$ must be satisfied before drainage occurs. It is calculated using an exponential function \citep{GashandMorton1978, Valenteetal1997, Pryetetal2012a}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_drainage}
D=% 
  \begin{cases}
    D_s \times exp(b(C - S)) &  \mathrm{if} \quad C > S \\
    \\
    0 & \mathrm{if} \quad C \leq S \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $D_s$ $\mathrm{[LT^{-1}]}$ and $b$ are canopy characteristics.

Evaporation of canopy is scaled down from the potential evaporation rate of the plot area ($E_p$) in proportion to the canopy cover and the amount of water stored by the canopy \citep{Pryetetal2012a}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_evaporation}
E=% 
  \begin{cases}
    (1-p) \times E_p & \mathrm{if} \quad C \geq S \\
    \\
    (1-p) \times C/S \times E_p & \mathrm{if} \quad C < S \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
When the canopy is saturated ($C \geq S$), $E$ reaches the potential evaporation rate. For unsaturated canopy ($C < S$), $E$ is proportional to the $C/S$ ratio \citep{Rutter1975, WhiteheadandKelliher1991, Valenteetal1997}. $E_p$ is estimated using the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation \citep{Monteith1965} with the surface resistance set to zero \citep{Rutter1975, Kelliheretal1993} and the aerodynamic resistance calculated from \cite{Rutter1971,Rutter1975} for moderate wind speeds:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ra}
    r_a = \dfrac{1}{k^2u_z}.\left(ln \left(\dfrac{z-d}{z_0} \right) \right)^2  
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the von Karman constant, $u_z$ is wind speed at the measured height, $z_0$ is the roughness length and $d$ is the zero plane displacement. Parameters used to estimate $r_a$ are obtained from \cite{Pryetetal2012a}.  

In this model, we consider $CWI$ by the canopy. Whereas intercepted rainfall depends of the proportion of the canopy cover, $CWI$ depends basically on the fog properties, wind speed intensity and canopy characteristics \citep{Bruijnzeeletal2006, Villegasetal2008, Holwerdaetal2010}. The first two factors can be assessed from the rate of intercepted cloud water of a passive fog gauge ($FGI$). Indeed, water collected by the gauge will be influenced by the fog characteristics and atmospheric conditions. Then, $CWI$ derived from $FGI$ would only depend of the canopy characteristics. To simplify the effect of the canopy characteristics, a parameter called \textit{fog interception capacity} ($fic$), is used for the estimation of $CWI$. Then, $CWI$ can be expressed as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_wi}
    CWI = fic \times FGI
\end{equation}
$CWI$ does not depend of the canopy cover but, rather, is only a proportion of $FGI$. $FGI$ should not be a vertical water input. However, we use $CWI$ to increase the vertical canopy water storage which is a fair assumption considering that $CWI$ will be stored by the canopy before dripping to the floor. 

Considering $CWI$, the wet canopy water budget is written as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_can_bal_cwi}
    \Delta C/\Delta t = (1 - p) \times RF + CWI - D - E 
\end{equation}
$P_{net}$ can be estimated from direct throughfall and drainage of canopy:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_thfall}
P_{net}=p \times RF + D
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Model implementation and calibration}
\subsubsection{Estimation of intercepted water by the fog net}
Considering that the passive fog gauge captures the combine volume of inclined rainfall, wind-driven drizzle and fog interception ($VF_T$), it is necessary to assess the amount of fog interception from $VF_T$. Even though, inclined rainfall can be assessed as shown below, the separation of fog and drizzle was not possible. Therefore, both components are treated together and referred as cloud water. In order to separate rainfall from cloud water, we make two assumptions: i) intensity and direction at which rainfall is intercepted by the passive fog rain gauges are the same, and ii) cloud water incidence is horizontal, so the interception surface of the fog net is the vertical face of its cylinder. During windy conditions, the rain gauge measures vertical rainfall ($RF_v$), which is the vertical component of actual rainfall ($RF_a$) with an inclination angle ($\gamma$). $\gamma$ is estimated at each time step from rainfall intensity, raindrop size, terminal fall velocity of the raindrops and wind speed \citep{Holwerdaetal2006}. Median raindrop diameter ($RD$) is calculated from the rainfall intensity \citep{LawsandParsons1943, Holwerdaetal2006}:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_D}
    RD = 2.23 \times (0.03937 \times RF_v)^{0.102}
\end{equation}
where $RD$ and $RF_v$ are in mm and mmh$^{-1}$, respectively.

The terminal fall velocity $U_D$ (ms$^{-1}$) is estimated from $D$ \citep{GunnandKinzer1949, Holwerdaetal2006}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_UD}
    U_D = 3.378 \times ln(RD) + 4.213
\end{equation}

Then, rainfall inclination angle is derived as \citep{HerwitzandSlye1995, Holwerdaetal2006}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_gamma}
    tan(\gamma) = U/RD
\end{equation}

$RF_a$ can be estimated with a trigonometric relationship as follows:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_rain1}
    RF_a = RF_v/cos(\gamma)
\end{equation}
where $RF_v$ is equivalent to the volume measured by the rain gauge divided by its horizontal circular surface. Therefore, $RF_a$ can also be determined from the measured volume divided by the projection of the horizontal circular surface perpendicular to the direction of $RF_a$, which corresponds to an ellipse.

Given the above assumptions and equivalence, in the passive fog gauge, the volume corresponding to $RF_a$ can be estimated as:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_vol1}
    VF_r = RF_a \times S_{fp}
\end{equation}
where $VF_r$ is the volume of intercepted rainfall by the passive fog gauge and $S_{fp}$ is the projected surface of the fog net perpendicular to the direction of $RF_a$ (Figure 5). $S_{fp}$ decreases with the first couple of degrees similarly to the rain gauge, until it reaches an inflection point, which corresponds to the appearance of the cylinder net, where $S_{fp}$ starts to increase considerably. $S_{fp}$ reaches a maximum value a couple of ten of degrees before the inclination of rainfall is horizontal, from this point it starts to decline until it reaches the horizontal projection surface of the cylinder. Because, $S_{fp}$ is a function of the $RF_a$ inclination angle and its geometry, then, the amount of cloud water intercepted by the fog gauge can be estimated as:
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_fog}
    FGI = \pi \times h_c \times D_c/2 \times (VF_T - fe \times VF_r)
\end{equation}
where $h_c$ and $D_c$ are the height and diameter of the cylinder, respectively, and $fe$ is a coefficient of correction obtained from the bias when comparing volumes between the passive fog and rain gauges during rainfall intensities with a low inclination angle.


\subsubsection{Corrections and calibration of the model}
The canopy model is implemented using 15-minutes time steps. Climatic variables measured at the weather station are assumed to be representative of the conditions at the top of the canopy. Corrected rainfall measured with the rain gauge is used as the incident rainfall at the canopy. When values of $FGI$ estimated with \autoref{eq:fog_fog} are negative (related to measurement errors), they are set to zero. Given that the plot is located in sloping terrain with an angle $\phi$, incident rainfall intercepted by the canopy ($RF_c$) is estimated using the relation proposed by \cite{Sharon1980}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fog_coef}
RF_v/RF_c = cos(\phi) + sin(\phi) \times tan(\gamma) \times cos(\Omega_a - \Omega_b) 
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_a$ is the slope aspect and $ \Omega_b$ is the wind direction. Using this relation, we consider that the top canopy surface is parallel to the sloping ground. 
  
Constant canopy parameters are assumed during the investigated period (June/2013 to May/2015). Canopy parameters ($p$, $S$, $D_s$, $b$ and $fic$) are calibrated with the \emph{Guauss-Levenberg-Marquadt} algorithm implemented in the PEST software \citep{PestDoherty2010} for the optimization of an objective function of minimum weighted least square (OMWLS) between simulated and observed throughfall during the hydrological year 2013-2014 and validated during the hydrological year 2014-2015. In order to reduce the problem of equafinality, the inversion convergence was insured with a \textit{Tikhonov} regularization scheme based on initial parameters, where a second objective function of regularization is optimized. In this way, parameters are constrained to the initial ones. $p$ and $S$ initial parameters were obtained using a within-event analysis of a set of rainfall storms detailed by \cite{Linketal2004}. In the case of $D_s$ and $b$, values were obtained from the literature. The parameter $fic$ was not constrained as it would depend entirely on the relation between the capacity of the canopy and this specific fog gauge system to intercept cloud water. Hence, no information is available about the a-priori value. Notice that in this approach, throughfall records are only used for validation purposes and not as inputs of the model.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Meteorological and below canopy measurements}
Long-term records from the weather station in Santa Cruz reveal that the hydrological year 2013-2014 (June to May) corresponds to an average year in terms of rainfall ($234$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$) and temperature ($24.0$ $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$), while the second year (2014-2015) is characterized by strong rainfall ($484$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$) and relative high air ($25.1$ $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$) and sea surface ($24.3$ $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$) temperatures. During the two-years observation period at the study site, daily average wind speed (2.7 ms$^{-1}$) and direction (195 $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$) remained similar at all seasons. $RH$ was close to, or at saturation for most part of the period. Solar radiation remained relatively low. Significant difference in temperatures is observed between seasons, where the daily average during the 2013-cool season is especially low. Total height of annual measured rainfall at the study site reaches $1762.5$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ and $2755.5$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$, for the first and second hydrological year, respectively. Incident rainfall at the canopy is $1848$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ during the first year and $2857.2$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ during the second year. This corresponds, respectively, to 105\% and 104\% of the measured rainfall by the rain gauge. Mean rainfall intensity is 0.37 mmh$^{-1}$ during the cool seasons and 0.86 mmh$^{-1}$ during the hot seasons.

$FGI$ is estimated using a selected set of precipitation data ($n=837$) from the rain and passive fog gauges when the rainfall inclination angle was lower than $2.5$ $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ (below this value, the surface of the cylinder has no influence and measurements from both gauges should be equivalent). Then, equivalent heights of water were compared. A relative bias of 0.12 was found between the height of water measured by the fog and rain gauges, which is associated to systematical errors in the fog gauge measurements. The estimated bias is used in \autoref{eq:fog_coef} as $fe=1.12$. Annual estimated $FGI$ is $1066$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ and $613$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ at the first and second year, respectively. From the annual $FGI$, 96\% corresponds to the cool seasons and 4\% to the hot seasons. $FGI$ was registered during 21\% and 12\% of the first and second cool seasons, respectively.
 
Due to clogging of the throughfall tipping buckets and electronic issues with the instrumentation, 21\% of the total throughfall data ($n=69216$) is unavailable. During the calibration period (2013-2014), available throughfall data available represents 87\% ($n=17453$) of the cool season and 82\% ($n=11884$) of the hot season. During the second year, it represents 74\% ($n=15274$) of the cool season and 67\% ($n=9711$) of the hot season. From the available records, total collected throughfall reaches 121\% and 105\% of the incident rainfall at the canopy, during the first and second year, respectively. These values are comparable to the 116-127\% and 126\% of an elfin cloud forest in La Reunion \citep{Gabrieletal2008} and Puerto Rico \citep{Holwerdaetal2006}, respectively. Difference of relative throughfall is marked between the cool and hot season at both years. During the first year, relative throughfall is 130\% and 84\% during the cool and hot seasons, respectively. Whereas, it reaches 110\% at the cool season and 88\% at the hot season of the second year. 

\subsection{Model calibration and validation}
Initial canopy parameters $p$ and $S$ were estimated with linear regressions from cumulative rainfall vs cumulative throughfall from a specific set of events with low relative throughfall values \citep{Pryetetal2012a}. Estimated $p$ is 0.37, while $S$ is 0.45 mm. These initial values were used in the OMWLS method to calibrate all canopy parameters. Calibrated parameters by this method can be observed in Table 2. Calibrated $fic$ indicates that 45\% of cloud water intercepted by the passive fog gauge is in fact $CWI$ by the vegetation. This value is realistic, given that at similar conditions, we expect that the fog net capacity to intercept cloud water is higher than the one of the vegetation given that the passive fog gauge is placed at a similar height than the canopy. During the calibration period (first year), RMSE of simulated throughfall is 0.060 mm ($n=9365$), whereas it reaches 0.096 mm ($n=4567$) at the second year. RMSE is estimated between the simulated and available throughfall disregarding data points where its value is equal to zero simultaneously for both datasets. Simulated cumulative throughfall is underestimated by 0.8\% and overestimated by 2.5\% over the first and second year, respectively. However, by season these values are different. During the cool seasons, throughfall is underestimated by 0.4\% in the first year and overestimated by 1.4\% in the second year, whereas, during the hot seasons, throughfall is overestimated by 8.6\% in both years.

Overestimation of throughfall could be related to an underestimation of the wet canopy evaporation, which might have an influence on the $CWI$ estimates. If the canopy parameters are expected to be correct (see \autoref{dis_int_model}), then the difference is consequence of an underestimation of evaporation (see \autoref{dis_pert_method}). To overcome this problem, potential wet canopy evaporation ($E_{wet}$) was considered using two alternatives: i) model B; using a linear model ($E_{wet} = a \times E_p + b)$ and ii) model C; replacing $E_p$ by a constant value during the cool and hot seasons. Even though the latter could be a rough consideration, it would provide mean estimates that could explain the overestimation of throughfall during the hot seasons. Extra parameters in model B and the optimization of mean wet canopy evaporation in model C are calibrated with the rest of parameters using the same methodology. Because the canopy parameters are constrained, slight differences in the calibration of their values are expected.  

Table 2 shows the resulting parameters and statistics of the calibration process. It appears that model B and C have a better performance than model A according to the estimated RMSE and bias. RMSE is relatively similar in the three models, but model C has the lowest values. During the cool season, all models have a low bias. However, in the hot season model C bias is the lowest reaching 1.2\% compared to the 5.1\% of model B and to the even worse 8.6\% of model A. Clearly model C shows a better performance than the other two models and it satisfactorily simulates throughfall along the study period (Figure 6 and Figure 7). With model C, simulated cumulative throughfall is overestimated by 0.6\% and 3.1\% over the first and second year, respectively.



\subsection{Cloud water interception and canopy water budget}
Model C was considered in the estimation of $CWI$ and the rest of the water budget variables because it shows the best performance and seems more coherence (see \autoref{dis_pert_method} and \autoref{dis_evaporation}). Cumulative $CWI$ by the canopy is $523$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ during the first year and $300$ $\mathrm{{mm}}$ during the second year (Table 3). These values represent 22\% and 10\% of the total water input of the first and second year, respectively. Seasonally, marked difference can be seen in the $CWI$ quantities. It represents 34\% and 18\% of the water inputs at the first and second cool season, respectively (Figure 8); while at the hot seasons, $CWI$ represents less than 2\%. Cumulative evaporation reaches 264 mm during the first year and 260 mm during the second year. These values correspond to 11\% and 8\% of the total water outputs for the first and second year, respectively. Contribution of actual evaporation during the cool seasons represent ca. 67\% of the annual $E$. This is expected, considering that during the cool season the canopy remains wet for longer periods, hence more water is subject to evaporation.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Pertinence of the methodology} \label{dis_pert_method}

The proposed methodology is established on a physically-based model, in which parameters and simulated values are confronted to real observations. Uncertainties in $CWI$ should be highlighted, given that its estimation is subject to the propagation of errors from both sampling and modeling. It remains open the discussion about possible underestimation of wet canopy evaporation applying the P-M theory. Possible errors are related to (a wide discussion about this matter is reported in \cite{vanDijketal2015}): advection of warm air from the nearby ocean \citep{Shuttleworth1979, Schellekensetal1999, Holwerdaetal2010}; heat release due to condensation of the air above the forest, thermal energy stored in the forest or in the ground \citep{Scatena1990, VanDijketal2001, vanDijketal2015}; mechanical water losses, such as the effect of the evaporation of splash droplets produced in the canopy \citep{Murakami2007, Dunkerley2009}; an underestimation of the aerodynamic resistance \citep{Holwerdaetal2012} and; errors in air humidity measurements \citep{Frumauetal2006, Holwerdaetal2010, Pryetetal2012a}. The first three processes put into question the validity of evaporation estimates with the P-M equation and their actual significance results challenging to quantify. Underestimation of the aerodynamic resistance could indeed happen in locations with complex topography and wind measurements different from above the canopy \citep{Holwerdaetal2012}. However, the study site is located in an open area with a relative constant slope and the wind direction is practically constant, which reduces the turbulent exchange in comparison with a complex terrain. Even though wind speed measurements are not performed above the canopy, these are performed near the forest at a similar height, therefore similar magnitudes are expected. Errors in air humidity measurements with permittivity sensors are common because these are not sensitive in near-saturation conditions, so they can be affected by rain splash and condensation can occur on the protection shield \citep{vanDijketal2015}. Moreover, humidity can remain soaked in the shield even though the air is drier in the exterior \citep{Pryetetal2012a}. Because the Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) term of the P-M equation is estimated from $RH$, an overestimation of $RH$ could have a considerable influence in the evaporation estimates. \cite{WallaceandMcJannet2008} and \cite{vanDijketal2015} estimated evaporation with a reduction of 2\% of $RH$ and reported an increase of 31\% and 34\% in evaporation, respectively. In a Puerto Rican elfin cloud forest,\cite{Holwerdaetal2006} showed that using a fixed value of RH (99.5\% instead of 100\%), estimated evaporation increased by 27\%. In the study site, when the canopy is saturated or partially saturated, the value of RH measured by the sensor is 100\% during 79\% and 93\% of the time of the cool and hot seasons, respectively. However, during rainfall events of the hot seasons conditions seemed drier (Author's observations). An overestimation of RH could easily explain the underestimation of evaporation by the P-M equation during the hot season. This issue could be addressed using dry- and wet-bulb temperature monitoring to estimate directly VPD \citep{Holwerdaetal2006, Holwerdaetal2010} or more sophisticated equipment such as eddy covarience instruments \citep{Holwerdaetal2012}. The latter allows direct measurements of aerodynamic conductance and heat fluxes, therefore other possible sources of errors could be addressed.

Fog inputs are introduced to the canopy model through a parameter ($fic$) that relates the capacity of cloud water interception between the canopy and the passive fog gauge. Though it might be a rough assumption it shows good results. \cite{Villegasetal2008} and \cite{Holwerdaetal2011} reported that the amount of fog interception measured by passive fog gauges and by vegetation is significantly correlated. However, passive fog gauge catch efficiency is wind speed dependent \citep{Frumauetal2011, Holwerdaetal2012}. Moreover, variation in cloud water fluxes and droplets size tend to affect the efficiency depending on the fog gauge system \citep{Frumauetal2011}. The proposed fog gauge system was built locally and there is no information about its efficiency. A Juvik-type fog gauge system \citep{Juvik1978} is the most similar to the one used in this study (but the net material is different). Juvik-type systems tend to increase its efficiency with wind speed but it is leveled off quickly between 2 and 4 ms$^{-1}$ reaching a plateau \citep{Frumauetal2011}. In this study, when $FGI$ is registered, wind speed is above 2 ms$^{-1}$ during 96\% of the time. Moreover, wind speed variation during cloud water is low, 92\% of registered $FGI$ occurred with wind speed values between 2 and 4 ms$^{-1}$. The relative high values and low variation of wind speed could justify the use of a constant value of $fic$ and therefore estimates of $CWI$ should remain fair. In order to overcome these uncertainties, a well-defined catch-efficiency fog gauge should be used \citep{Holwerdaetal2011, Frumauetal2011}.
%The low percentage of $FGI$ during low wind speeds ($<$ 2 ms$^{-1}$) may suggest that the fog gauge system performs inefficiently under these conditions. If so, CWI is probably low and should not affect the estimations, as the RMSE during the cool season is relatively low. 

In this study, we use throughfall only for validation purposes and not as inputs to estimate $CWI$. This is an important advantage given that throughfall monitoring is challenging to maintain and continuous observations are hardly available. This method could be applied in a comparative study, in which estimates of $CWI$ can be compared between different vegetation using one fixed fog gauge system. In this way, the canopy characteristics that influence $CWI$ could be identified. Also, installing the same systems in different areas of the same region can lead to the identification of the driving factors influencing fog intensity. 


\subsection{Interception model and wet canopy evaporation} \label{dis_evaporation}
Three variations of wet canopy evaporation were used in this study. Even though we use a fixed $E_{wet}$ value per season, which should be more influential on the RMSE estimation increasing its value, model C presents the better performance according to the estimated RMSE and bias (Table 2). Model A has the lowest rates of $E_{wet}$, with higher values during the cool season, which is strange, considering the particular conditions of each season. This could be a consequence of the predominance of the radiation term in $E_p$ due to saturation conditions, which is also recurrent during the hot season. In model B, $E_{wet}$ is also higher during the hot season because this value depends directly on $E_p$. However, $E_{wet}$ is considerably higher than model in A (74\% and 97\% higher during the cool and hot seasons, respectively). In this model, the constant term $b_e$ represents ca. 48\% of $E_{wet}$, which shows the need to increase the overall evaporation regardless of the variation of the 15-min $E_p$. Such result also justifies the use of a fixed value of $E_{wet}$. In model C, fixed values of $E_{wet}$ are also higher than model in A (3\% and 66\% higher during the cool and hot seasons, respectively). However, the variation during the cool season is small compared with the one on the hot season, and therefore $E_{wet}$ during the hot season is 24\% higher than the one of the cool season (contrary to the other models). Indeed, during the hot season, higher $E_{wet}$ should be expected due to a higher VPD which cannot be considered as a consequence of a possible overestimation of the RH. In the same matter, similar values are expected during the cool season given the wet conditions where the radiation term is the more predominant one in the equation. 

%This is probably because 15-min estimates of $E_p$ have small variations (89\% of $E_p$ between 0 and 0.1 mm) and rainfall rates are considerably higher than actual evaporation estimated with \autoref{eq:fog_evaporation}.

Differences in the P-M and measured-derived wet canopy evaporation have been reported as well in other studies \citep{Scatena1990, Dykes1997, Waterlooetal1999, Schellekensetal1999, WallaceandMcJannet2008, Holwerdaetal2012}. \cite{Calderetal1986} proposed using large values of maximum canopy storage ($S$) in order to increase evaporation. However, an overestimation of $S$ could be considered an artefact given that such high value might not represent the actual characteristics of the canopy \citep{Lloydetal1988}. Another solution is an optimization of the wet canopy evaporation. \cite{Schellekensetal1999} reported a large overestimation of throughfall using a value of 0.11 mmh$^{-1}$ of wet canopy evaporation derived from the P-M equation. The authors optimized this value to 2.8 mmh$^{-1}$ using a trial error procedure in a Rutter model to overcome this issue. \cite{Holwerdaetal2012} also reported a difference between $E_{wet}$ derived from throughfall measurements (0.63 mm h$^{-1}$) and calculated with the PM equation (0.16 mm h$^{-1}$) with a meteorological station in the monitored forest. The authors corrected this estimate to 0.58 mm h$^{-1}$ using the same P-M equation, but instead of using the conventionally derived estimates of $r_a$ (such as \autoref{eq:ra}), they used direct measurements of $r_a$ using eddy covariance instruments. In this study, a fixed value of $E_{wet}$ corresponding to each season has been calibrated with the rest of the canopy parameters.

Canopy parameters are relatively similar in the three models, except for $S$ and $D_s$, probably because of their imposed restrictions and/or because they have a low influence in the throughfall estimates. $fic$, which is a free parameter that controls the quantity of $CWI$ barely varies between the three models (0.45-0.51). The relatively large change of the wet canopy evaporation has a small effect on $CWI$. This fact has been already reported by \cite{Holwerdaetal2006} when they tested the effect of an increase in interception losses to the overall fog deposition.

\subsection{Canopy parameters} \label{dis_int_model}

Calibrated canopy parameters $p$ and $S$ are comparable with values found in the literature \citep{Aston1979, Lloydetal1988, WallaceandMcJannet2008, Takahashietal2011, Holwerdaetal2012}. While the value of $p$ can be comparable with the one ($p=0.3$) found by \cite{Pryetetal2012a} for the same type of vegetation in Santa Cruz Island, $S$ is higher in this study (0.23 mm reported by \cite{Pryetetal2012a}) and comparable with a secondary forest in Santa Cruz Island (0.62 mm) reported by \cite{Dominguezetal2016}. The difference might be related to a larger dataset used in this study (which include both seasons), differences in the methodology, and the larger presence of moses observed in this forest. Despite small values of $S$ associated with average values of $p$ are attributed to a single storey tree architecture and sparse understorey vegetation \citep{Pryetetal2012a}, such as in the present study, the abundant presence of moses may play an important role on the value of $S$. Indeed, they have a high water storage capacity, a slow drainage and their effect in throughfall differs to the structural components of the forest \citep{Richardsonetal2000, Kohleretal2007, Villegasetal2008}. However, it should be considered that in wet conditions epiphytes are unable to accomodate additional moisture \citep{Holscheretal2004}. Estimated $S$ found in the \textit{Miconia} forest is comparable with the value of 0.5 mm reported by \cite{Holwerdaetal2006} for a 3 m high evergreen forest in Puerto Rico and it is within the range (0.39 - 1.59 mm) reported by \cite{NavarndBryan1994} in a 2 m semi-arid dense scrub vegetation in Mexico. $fic$ shows the capacity of the canopy to intercept fog compared to the artificial fog net. Despite this value is related to canopy characteristics; its significance remains related to the efficiency and capacity of the fog gauge to capture fog. Indeed, the efficiency of the fog gauge depends on the type, material and form \citep{Villegasetal2008}. Nevertheless, estimations of $CWI$ by the vegetation would remain fair, because they are subject to the validation of the model. 

\subsection{Cloud water interception}
Estimated $CWI$ is negligible during the hot seasons while during the cool seasons it is significant. $CWI$ represents 52\% and 21\% of the incident rainfall during the first and second cool season, respectively. These values are relative high comparing to studies reviewed by \cite{Bruijnzeeletal2011} (4\%-45\%) and others reported in the literature (6\%-31\%) \citep{Hutleyetal1997, Holwerdaetal2006, McJannetetal2007a, Holwerdaetal2010, Ueharaetal2012}. However, they are small compared to the 93\% found by \cite{CavalierandGoldstein1989}. Daily average $CWI$ is 2.3 mm and 1.3 mm during the first and second cool seasons, respectively. \cite{Pryetetal2012a} estimated daily $CWI$ of 1.2 mm for the same type of vegetation at a similar altitude (650 m a.s.l.) in another island of Galapagos during the 2010 cool season. This value can be comparable with the value found in the 2014 cool season of this study. \cite{Giambellucaetal2011} reported daily $CWI$ of 0.43 mm for low shrubs and trees in Hawaii, \cite{Ritteretal2008} found values of 0.7 mm in a elfin laurel forest in Canary, \cite{Holwerdaetal2006} reported values of 2.14 mm for a 3 m tall Puerto Rican cloud forest, while \cite{CavalierandGoldstein1989} found values of 2.18 mm in a cloud forest in Colombia. Estimates of daily $CWI$ reported by \cite{Ueharaetal2012} reach 3.26 mm for a dwarf coniferous shrub in the Japan Alps.

Estimates of $CWI$ by the vegetation are contrasting between the two cool seasons. The difference can be related to changes in the canopy structure or due to meteorological factors. Indeed, changes in the canopy structure are likely to happen. \cite{Aboaletal2000} found that heavy thinning of a pine forest in Tenerife, led to a long-term decline in throughfall. However, it should have a small effect on the estimates given that $CWI$ is a proportion of the quantity measured by the fog gauge and simulated cumulative throughfall remain close to the observed ones during both cool seasons. Considering constant canopy characteristics, $CWI$ is basically driven by the fog liquid water content (FLWC) and wind speed intensity \citep{Villegasetal2008}. \cite{Villegasetal2008} reported that $CWI$ is constraint at low FLWC by limited fog availability and at high FLWC, by precipitation potential. The authors also concluded that optimal conditions for $CWI$ are during medium values of FLWC and wind speed. FLWC was not measured in this study, nevertheless its presence can be assessed from wind speed measurements during $CWI$. Generally, for higher wind speeds, mean $CWI$ increases at both cool seasons, but some difference can be identified (Table 9). At the first cool season, average $CWI$ constantly increases with wind speed, even at high intensities. On the contrary, during the second cool season, the increase reaches a plateau around 5 ms$^{-1}$. $CWI$ during the first season starts at lower values of wind speed than the second season. The plateau of $CWI$ and its late start with lower wind speeds, suggest that FLWC is lower than its optimal conditions, whereas FLWC during the first seasons seems optimal, given that there is enough FLWC at low wind speeds to be intercepted and at higher wind speeds it does not yet reaches its peak. For this reason, we consider that the higher values of $CWI$ during the first cool season are related to a higher FLWC that combined with the observed wind speeds enhances better conditions of $CWI$ compared with the second season. an important fact that supports this hypothesis is that average values of meteorological variables of the two cool seasons are similar, except for temperature, which is significant higher during the second cool season (ca. $2$ $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$). Such a difference in temperature might be related to a previous effect of the 2015-2016 Niño event. Indeed, according to the data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the El Niño 1$+$2 region (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/CDB/Tropics/figt5.shtml) and the CDF Meteorological Database (http://www.darwinfoundation.org/datazone/climate/), a sea surface temperature anomaly has been registered during the 2014 cool season (c.a. $1$ $\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$). Temperature could explain the difference in FLWC, given that higher FLWC is inversely related to the latent heat of condensation of water temperature \citep{Thompson2007}. Such conditions probably produce the rise of the cloud base reducing fog occurrence in the highlands. It seems that El Niño events might have a negative effect in the FLWC and thus, reducing cloud water interception. 


\section{Conclusions}
We have proposed a methodology to estimate CWI by the vegetation using a \textit{Rutter-type} interception model. The approach requires the acquisition of input and calibration datasets. Inputs consist in continuous records of meteorological variables, which include cloud water measurements using a fog gauge system. Meanwhile, samples of throughfall are necessary for the calibration and validation of the model only and not as inputs in the model, which is an important advantage considering that continuous records are challenging to obtain.

The model has been implemented in an endemic forest of the windward highlands of San Cristobal Island, in which the presence of fog is semi-permanent during half of a year. In these conditions, this is the first compiling approach for water balance estimation. Results show that $CWI$ reaches 22\% and 10\% of the total water input of the first and second year, respectively. During the hot seasons, $CWI$ is negligible, while it represents 34\% and 18\% of the water inputs during the first and second cool seasons, respectively. Despite similar wind speed intensities are observed in both cool seasons, a higher $CWI$ is observed during the first cool season and it is related to higher LWC in the air that combined with the observed wind speed intensities, leads to better conditions of $CWI$.  

Estimated throughfall was overestimated during the hot season as a consequence of an overestimation of the wet canopy evaporation using the Penman-Monteith equation. Such difference was overcome using a fixed value of wet canopy evaporation for each season, obtained from an optimization process. The passive fog gauge used allowed the estimation of cloud water interception by the vegetation. Nevertheless, there is no information about its cloud water catch-efficiency which could be affected by wind speed and other factors. Such type of uncertainties could be overcome using a well-defined catch-efficiency fog gauge system.

In this study we determined that $CWI$ is a notable source of water in the highlands of the island, particularly during the first year which is considered to be an average year in terms of climate. Therefore, the role of vegetation in the highlands is important to the hydrology of the island. During the cool season, given the low intensity of throughfall contribution to the soil and its relative high infiltration capacity, $CWI$ will most likely contribute to groundwater recharge. If climate change produces an increase in the temperature, and therefore a raise of the fog layer formation, it will probably result in a reduction of cloud water interception. In addition, land use change from the endemic forest to pasture still occurs on the highlands; which will most probably induce a reduction of net precipitation, and hence a reduction of discharge of the downwards rivers originated from springs.
